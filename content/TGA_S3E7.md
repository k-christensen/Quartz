# Initial Reaction:
Jaw dropped at the end. It had me combing through next week's preview to see if George was actually going to be killed off or if he's just injured. I still don't like Marian even though she had some rare Ws here with her covering for Oscar and with her distrusting Larry because he lied to her. Also really hope that Bertha gets her redemption arc because I am a ride or die for that character.
